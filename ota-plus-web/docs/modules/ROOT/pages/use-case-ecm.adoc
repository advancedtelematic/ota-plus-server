= Update engine shutdown calibration on an ECM 

Suppose that you work for a vehicle brand called "Lannista". Your vehicles are popular in Scandinavia, but you have been receiving complaints about a specific problem: in winter, people keep their engines on when waiting in their vehicles so that they can use the heating system to stay warm. However, the engines keep automatically shutting down after a minute or so. This means that people have to constantly restart their engines.
Your head developer tells you that this is the software problem. To save energy, an idling engine is configured to shut down after the temperature falls below a certain level. Luckily, you can fix this issue with an OTA update.

== Your production environment

You have your vehicle data in a sophisticated system called CarHQ that integrates with your customer database called CustomerHQ. 

Your CarHQ system contains the following detailed information about all the vehicles in your fleet: model, build date, warranty date, and region. It can also tell you information about customers, what vehicle they have purchased, and what support contract they're on.

== A new release is announced

Your release manager contacts you and says that they want to update the software on the Engine Control Module (ECM) in the following way: 

* Extend the engine idle time as much as possible to allow the Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) to keep the driver comfortable during extreme weather conditions. 
* If the temperature falls below 7.2 degrees Celsius or above 35 degrees Celsius, the updated software overrides the engine shutdown.

They have the following release conditions:

* The release only applies to editions of the Lannista "Tireon" model built after 2018.
* Restrict the software update to the Scandinavian market.
* Target only customers who selected premium support.

== Create a device group

You can run detailed search queries in CarHQ and export the data to a CSV file. Your search query might look something like this. It is simplified for this tutorial.

[source,sql]
----
Select VIN
FROM CustomerView
WHERE model="Tireon" AND "BuildDate => 2018-01-01" AND Region IN ('DK, NO, SE, FI') AND SupportLevel ="010A"
----

In this case, create a fixed device group. A smart device group is not sophisticated enough for your query since smart groups can only filter by device ID. Instead, you can use a fixed group and import the search results that you exported from CarHQ.

Before you group your vehicles, they must already exist as devices in OTA Connect. In other words, your developers should have provisioned these devices with a proper device identifier. For our tutorial, we are using the VIN.

+++ </div></details> +++

For the sake of this use case, let's assume that you exported a file called *Tireon-vins.txt* from CarHQ.

*To create the device group:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the *Groups* pane, click *Create group*.
. Select *Fixed device group*, and then click *Next*.
. Specify the group name: *Tireon-2018-Scandinavia-010A*.
. Click *Choose file*, navigate to the *Tireon-vins.txt* file, and then select it.
+
You should see matching devices that show up in your group. For the sake of simplicity, let's say that the group contains exactly 1,000 devices. This is useful to know when you track the progress of your software updates.

== Create a software update

// MC: Hack to make this section collapsible

*Prerequisites* 
+++ </summary><div> +++

Your developers have built a baseline disk image that contains the compatible software for your control unit (ECU) hardware. In this case, the ECU uses a Renesas RL78 board that has the following criteria:

* The exact board model is a Renesas RL78/F15, so the machine configuration is `RL7815`.
* The software for the ECM is based on the FreeRTOS kernel.
* The name of the image is a combination of the board model and ECM: `ECM-RL7815-FRTOS`.

Version 1.0 of this image contains the problematic calibration for the engine idle shutdown timer.

To prepare the new software update, your developers have to:

* Build a version of the baseline disk image
* Change the minor version to V1.0.1.
+
It is a minor release because the calibration for the engine idle shutdown timer is the only thing that your developers changed on the disk image.

+++ </div></details> +++

As part of the build process, the disk image is automatically uploaded to your OTA Connect software versions. Your developers have kindly left the following internal release note.

.Release Note
====
Update for RL78/15 ECMs on post-2018 Tireon models.

CHANGES:

* Engine idle shutdown timer calibration now overrides engine shutdown if the temperature falls below 7.2°C or above 35°C.
====

So you know that you need version 1.0.1 of the disk image for Renesas RL78/15 microcontrollers that are used as engine control modules on all Lannista "Tireon" models produced after 2018.

*To create the software update:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/updates[*Software updates*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the upper-right corner, under the name of your active environment, click *Create update*.
. In *Software update name*, specify the name of your software update.

// MC: Might need more details
When you create a campaign, you can configure a notification for end users. The text of this notification is then passed on to the OTA Connect client software version that runs on the vehicle. The OTA Connect client can output the text of this message, but your developers need to make sure that this message is passed to the IVI and displayed on-screen in the dashboard so that the vehicle owner can reply to requests for their consent. 

+++ </div></details> +++

*To create the campaign:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/campaigns[*Campaigns*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the upper-right corner, under the name of your active environment, click *Create campaign*.
. Specify the campaign name, and then click *Next*.
+
.Campaign name
====
Deploy HVAC improvement - Scandinavia/Tireon post-2018
====
. Select the *Tireon-2018-Scandinavia-010A* device group, and then click *Next*.
. Select the *Improve HVAC in extreme conditions* software update, and then click *Next*.
. Since the installation is going to affect the operation of the engine, you need to ask the vehicle owner if you can temporarily disable the engine and install the software update. For that, select *Request end user's consent*.
. In the *Release note* field, enter the following notification text, and then click *Next*.
+
.Example Release Note
====
The Lannista customer care team has released a new software update that improves your vehicle's heating and air conditioning in extreme weather conditions.

To install this software update, your engine will shut down for about 15 seconds.

Do you want to download and install this software update to your vehicle? 
====
. At the *Summary* step, to start the campaign, click *Launch*.

+
The campaign starts to run. You can monitor devices that detect and download the new software update.

== Monitor the campaign 

Now that you have launched the campaign, you may want to see what percentage of 1,000 vehicles have successfully installed the software update. This might take a while since not all the vehicles will connect and install the software update at the same time. Additionally, some end users might decline to install the update, and in a few cases, the update might fail to install for various technical reasons.

You can get a good overview of the progress on the campaign details page.

*To see the campaign details:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/campaigns[*Campaigns*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Navigate to the *Deploy HVAC improvement - Scandinavia/Tireon post-2018* campaign, and then click it.

The section with campaign details expands.

After one day, you can check in and see what has happened with the campaign. Suppose that you see the following statistics:

.Status report for the campaign "Deploy HVAC improvement - Scandinavia/Tireon post-2018"
[width="100%",options="header"]
|====================
| Status | % | Number  
| Successful | 83% | 830 
| Installing | 9% | 90 
| Not applicable | 6% | 60  
| Failed | 2% | 20 
|====================

The good news is that control units on most devices can install the software update. A few devices are still installing it or have not connected yet.

What you may be concerned about the devices that have not installed the software update -- either because they are not applicable or the software update has failed for whatever reason.

== Troubleshoot failed updates 

Some of your devices failed to install the software update, so you may want to search for the installation report.

*To get the installation report:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/campaigns[*Campaigns*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Navigate to the *Deploy HVAC improvement - Scandinavia/Tireon post-2018* campaign, and then click it.
+
The campaign details section expands. The section also contains a list of failure codes.
. To get more information about each failure code and see the affected devices, in the *Export device statistics* column, next to the needed failure code, click the export button (image:img::download.png[Icon,20,20]).
+
You get a CSV file with the following details on the failure: the ID of the affected device, failure code, and failure description.

The failures in the *Deploy HVAC improvement - Scandinavia/Tireon post-2018* campaign occurred due to the following reasons:

* Users rejected the software update.
+
Since the software update is not safety-critical, ignore the devices that have this error.
* A control unit has a technical defect.
+
For example, you get the following failure code: *Assign BOOT Service Unavailable*. The ID of the device that has this failure is *JTHFF2C26B2515161*. To get more details:

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Search for the device with the ID *JTHFF2C26B2515161*.
. Click the device.
+
The page with the device details opens.
+
You notice that the ECM on this device has not successfully installed updates for the last six months. In this case, it would be good to contact the vehicle owner and ask them to visit a local dealership for further diagnosis.

You can also query the historical installation records for all update operations to see if there are control units on other devices that have consistently failed to install updates in the last six months.
