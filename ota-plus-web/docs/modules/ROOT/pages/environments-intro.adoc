An environment is your working space where you can create and manage software update projects.

You can share your environment with your colleagues to work together on devices, device groups, software versions, software updates, and campaigns. You can also become a member of other environments and collaborate on their projects.

In the environments to which you have access, you can xref:manage-members.adoc[add and remove] members as well as xref:find-and-change-environments.adoc[switch] between the environments.
