= Group Your Devices

Once enough devices have been provisioned, you should organize them into groups so that you can target them in your campaigns.

There have two types of group: *fixed group* and *smart group*.

* The *fixed group* type is useful if you already have a fixed list of devices that you want to update.
* The *smart group* type is useful if you know the selection criteria for devices to update but don't yet have a fixed list of devices.
+
Even if you do have a list, smart groups can also come in handy when your list is constantly being appended with new devices. Smart groups automatically group newly provisioned devices that match certain selection criteria.

== Create Fixed Groups

*To create a fixed group, follow these steps:*

.  Open the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[Devices] tab and click *+Add group*.
.  Select *Fixed Group* and click Next.
.  In the next window, enter a group name.
.  Assign devices to your group.
..  If you have a list of devices that you want to put in your group, upload your list and click *Create*.
+
This list should be a `.txt` file with one ID on each line.
+
Before you upload this list, make sure that you've provisioned all of the specified devices first.
+
NOTE: By default, OTA Connect automatically generates device IDs during the provisioning process. Currently, there's no way to get a list of these IDs. However, to create this list, you need to know the device IDs for all the devices that you've provisioned. The best way to create this list is to have your developers xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[define the device IDs] and keep a list of the IDs that they've configured.
+
..  If you don't have a list, you can add devices manually.
+
Click *Create* to finish creating your group, open the *All devices* or *Ungrouped devices* section, then drag and drop each device on to the group that you just created.

== Create Smart Groups

*To create a smart group, follow these steps:*

1.  Open the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[Devices] tab and click *+Add group*.
2.  Select *Smart Group* and click Next.
3.  In the next window, enter a group name and define a filter for your devices.
+
A filter helps OTA Connect assign each vehicle to a fleet. Currently, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the Device ID. By default OTA Connect generates a random device ID for you. But developers can xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[configure the device ID] to be whatever you want.
+
In this procedure, we'll use the VIN number as an example of a device ID.
+
* To create a filter, select *Device ID* from the *Data* dropdown.
* In the Filter dropdown, select your filter criteria.
+
Since every character in the VIN number has a meaning, we could select *Has character equal to*, enter the letter *M*, and select *in position 10* (the 10th character in a VIN number is usually the model).
* OTA Connect will tell you how many devices match this criteria.
4.  Assuming you have devices that match, click *Create* to create your smart group.
+
The smart group is "smart" because any new vehicles that register with OTA Connect will be filtered into this group as long as they also match the filter criteria.

IMPORTANT: You can't change the criteria of a smart group after you've created it. If you made a mistake with the filter criteria, create another smart group.
