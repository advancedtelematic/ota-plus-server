= Remove a custom device field

If you want to remove any of your custom device fields, <<portal, modify them on the OTA Connect portal>> or <<csv, upload a new or modified delimiter-separated file>>.

NOTE: You cannot delete a field if it is the only filter in at least one of your smart device groups.

[[portal]]
== Remove a field on the OTA Connect portal

You can delete any of your custom device fields on the OTA Connect portal.

*To delete a field on the portal:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Next to *Custom device fields*, click the cogwheel.

. In the *Custom device fields* dialog box, next to the title of the field that you want to delete, click the bin icon.
+
[.lightbackground.align_img_left]
image::img::delete_field.png[image,450]

. Click *Yes, delete*.

The custom device field is deleted. Your smart groups that have the removed field as one of the filters now only target devices based on the remaining fields that you have selected for these smart groups. However, campaigns that targeted devices with this field are not adjusted: devices cannot be added or removed after a campaign has already begun.

[[csv]]
== Remove a field using a CSV file

You can use a CSV file to delete a custom device field.

include::add-custom-device-field.adoc[tag=modified_csv]

*To remove custom device fields, modify your file in the following way:*

. In the first column, specify all of the device IDs that have the custom device field that you want to remove.
. In the next columns, specify all the existing custom device fields and the related values but omit the fields that you want to remove.
+
When you remove a field in a file:
+
** If you include several devices and omit a field, the field will have empty values for the included devices. You will still be able to use this field to group other devices.
** If you include all devices and omit a field, the field will be deleted. You will not be able to group devices using this field.
** If you include all devices and a field has empty values, the field will still exist and show empty values. You will not be able to group devices using this field.

Your smart groups that are based on the removed field no longer target devices with this field. However, campaigns that targeted devices with this field are not adjusted: devices cannot be added or removed after a campaign has already begun.

.Remove an obsolete field
====
For three provisioned devices, *CAR1*, *CAR2*, and *CAR3*, you have created three custom device fields: *Trim level*, *Country*, and *City*.

include::manage-values-of-custom-device-fields.adoc[tags=premium_german_example]

Now, you no longer need the *Country* field and want to remove it. 

The file you upload should look like this:

```
DeviceID;Trim level;City
CAR1;Premium;Berlin
CAR2;Premium;Berlin
CAR3;Premium;Berlin
```

Now, you cannot create a new smart group based on the deleted *Country* field. Also, your *Premium German* group no longer contains the *Country* field. However, the list of devices in the *January Update - Premium Germany* running campaign remains unchanged. It still targets *CAR1* and *CAR2*.
