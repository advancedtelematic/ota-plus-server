= Create a smart group

Smart groups are based on a device filter. They automatically group newly provisioned devices that match your selection criteria.

*To create a smart group:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the *Groups* pane, click *Create group*.

. Select *Smart device group*, and then click *Next*.
. Specify the group name and define a filter for your devices.
+
A filter helps OTA Connect assign each device to a group. Currently, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the device ID. The device ID is defined in the OTA Connect client configuration. If no ID is configured for the device, OTA Connect automatically generates one for you. But developers can xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[configure device IDs] to be whatever you want.
+
*Example (a vehicle identification number (VIN) is used as a device ID):*

.. From the *Data* list, select *Device ID*.
.. Since every character in the VIN has a meaning, select *Has character equal to*, enter the letter *M*, and select *in position 10* (the 10th character in a VIN is usually the model).
+
OTA Connect shows how many devices match your filter criteria.

IMPORTANT: You cannot change the criteria of a smart group after you create it. If you made a mistake with the filter criteria, create another smart group.

. Click *Create*.
+
The created group appears in the *Groups* pane. If a new provisioned device meets the specified filter criteria, it is automatically added to the group.
