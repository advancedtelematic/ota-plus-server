= Create a smart group

Smart groups are based on a device filter. They automatically group newly provisioned devices that match your selection criteria.

// tag::smart_group[]

*To create a smart group:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the *Groups* pane, click *Create group*.

. Select *Smart device group*, and then click *Next*.
. Specify the group name.
. Define a filter for your devices.

Filters help HERE OTA Connect assign each device to a group. For example, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the device ID. The device ID is defined in the OTA Connect client configuration, and is set on the server when the device connects for the first time.footnote:[To learn how to xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[configure device IDs\], see the developer documentation. Note that the device ID cannot be changed after it is set.] If no ID is configured on the device, a random ID is automatically generated.
+
*Example:*
+
You need to provision 2019 car models. Each device ID is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number[vehicle identification number (VIN), window="_blank"] where the 10th character is the letter K.

.. From the *Filter* list, select *Device ID*.
.. Since every character in the VIN has a meaning, from the *Type* list, select *has character equal to*.
.. In the *Value* field, enter the letter *K*, and then select *in position 10*  (the 10th character in a VIN is usually the model).
+
OTA Connect shows how many devices match your filter criteria.

IMPORTANT: You cannot change the criteria of a smart group after you create it. If you made a mistake with the filter criteria, create another smart group.

. (Optional) To add additional filters, click **Add filter**, specify its criteria, and select one of the following filter combinations:
** If you want to add devices that match both of the filters, select **And**.
** If you want to add devices that match one of the filters, select **Or**.
. Click *Create*.
+
The created group appears in the *Groups* pane. If a new provisioned device meets the specified filter criteria, it is automatically added to the group. If a device is deleted, it is automatically removed from the group.
