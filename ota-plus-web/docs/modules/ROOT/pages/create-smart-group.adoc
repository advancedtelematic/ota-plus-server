= Create a smart group

Smart groups are based on a device filter. They automatically group newly provisioned devices that match your selection criteria.

// tag::smart_group[]

*To create a smart group:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Click *Create group*.

. Select *Smart device group*, and then click *Next*.
. Specify the group name.
. Define a filter for your devices.

A filter helps HERE OTA Connect match each device to a group. Currently, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the device ID or your xref:ota-web::create-custom-device-fields.adoc[custom device fields]. The device ID is defined in the OTA Connect client configuration, and is set on the server when the device connects for the first time.footnote:[To learn how to xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[configure device IDs\], see the developer documentation. Note that the device ID can't be changed after it's set.] If no ID is configured on the device, a random ID is automatically generated.
+
*Example:*
+
You need to provision 2019 car models. Each device ID is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number[vehicle identification number (VIN), window="_blank"] where the 10th character is the letter K.

.. From the *Filter* list, select *Device ID*.
.. Since every character in the VIN has a meaning, from the *Type* list, select *has character equal to*.
.. In the *Value* field, enter the letter *K*, and then select *in position 10*  (the 10th character in a VIN is usually the model).
+
OTA Connect shows how many devices match your filter criteria.

IMPORTANT: You cannot change the criteria of a smart group after you create it. If you made a mistake with the filter criteria, create another smart group.

. (Optional) To add additional filters, click **Add filter**, specify its criteria, and select one of the following filter combinations:
** If you want to add devices that match both of the filters, select **And**.
** If you want to add devices that match one of the filters, select **Or**.
. Click *Create*.
+
The created group appears in the *Groups* pane. If a new provisioned device meets the specified filter criteria, it is automatically added to the group. If a device is deleted, it is automatically removed from the group.
