= Create a smart group

Smart groups are based on a device filter. They automatically group newly provisioned devices that match your selection criteria.

// tag::smart_group[]

*To create a smart group:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Click *Create group*.

. Select *Smart device group*, and then click *Next*.
. Specify the group name.
. In the *Cluster* section, define a filter for your devices.

Filters help HERE OTA Connect match each device to a group. Currently, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the device ID or your xref:ota-web::create-custom-device-fields.adoc[custom device fields]. The device ID is defined in the OTA Connect client configuration and is set on the server when the device connects for the first time.footnote:[To learn how to xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[configure device IDs\], see the developer documentation. Note that the device ID can't be changed after it's set.] If no ID is configured on the device, a random ID is automatically generated.
+
IMPORTANT: You cannot change the filter criteria of a smart group after you create it. If you made a mistake with the filter criteria, create another smart group.
+
.Example
+
====
You need to provision 2019 car models. Each device ID is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number[vehicle identification number (VIN), window="_blank"] where the 10th character is the letter K.

.. From the *Filter* list, select *Device ID*.
.. Since every character in the VIN has a meaning, from the *Type* list, select *has character equal to*.
.. In the *Value* field, enter the letter *K*, and then select *in position 10*  (the 10th character in a VIN is usually the model).
+
OTA Connect shows how many devices match your filter criteria.

. (Optional) Add more filters:
** If you want to target devices that match both filters, in the same *Cluster* section, click *Add filter*, and then specify its criteria.
** If you want to target devices that match one of the filters or filter combinations, click *Add cluster*, and then specify the needed filter or filters.
+
.Example
====
You want to target devices with the *Premium* value in the *Trim level* field and the *Germany* or *France* value in the *Market* field. You have already created the following xref:ota-web::create-custom-device-fields.adoc[custom device fields]: *Trim level* and *Market*. In the *Create device group* dialog box, specify the following filters:

.. In the first *Cluster* section, select the *Market* filter and the *Contains* type, and then specify the *Germany* value.
.. Click *Add filter*.
.. In the new filter fields, select the *Trim level* filter and the *Contains* type, and then specify the *Premium* value.
.. Click *Add cluster*.
.. In the new cluster, select the *Market* filter and the *Contains* type, and then specify the *France* value.
.. Click *Add filter*.
.. In the new filter fields, select the *Trim level* filter and the *Contains* type, and then specify the *Premium* value.
