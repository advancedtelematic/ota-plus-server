= Create a smart group

Smart groups automatically group newly provisioned devices that match your selection criteria.

*To create a smart group, follow these steps:*

1.  Open the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[Devices] tab and click *+Add group*.
2.  Select *Smart Group* and click Next.
3.  In the next window, enter a group name and define a filter for your devices.
+
A filter helps OTA Connect assign each vehicle to a fleet. Currently, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the Device ID. By default OTA Connect generates a random device ID for you. But developers can xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[configure the device ID] to be whatever you want.
+
In this procedure, we'll use the VIN number as an example of a device ID.
+
* To create a filter, select *Device ID* from the *Data* dropdown.
* In the Filter dropdown, select your filter criteria.
+
Since every character in the VIN number has a meaning, we could select *Has character equal to*, enter the letter *M*, and select *in position 10* (the 10th character in a VIN number is usually the model).
* OTA Connect will tell you how many devices match this criteria.
4.  Assuming you have devices that match, click *Create* to create your smart group.
+
The smart group is "smart" because any new vehicles that provision with OTA Connect will be filtered into this group as long as they also match the filter criteria.

IMPORTANT: You can't change the criteria of a smart group after you've created it. If you made a mistake with the filter criteria, create another smart group.
