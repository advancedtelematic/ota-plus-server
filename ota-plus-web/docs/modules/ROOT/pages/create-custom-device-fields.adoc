= Create custom device fields

To filter devices in a smart group, you can use their IDs or custom device fields. Before you create new fields, make sure that you already provisioned the needed device IDs. Otherwise, they will be ignored.

*To create custom device fields for the first time:*

. Create a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values[delimiter-separated file] containing custom device fields.
+
TIP: You can use Microsoft Excel to generate CSV files. If you are working with Excel, keep your data in it until you are ready to export the data to CSV. Once you export to CSV, do not open the CSV file with Excel because Excel can change the data. If you want to verify the data in your CSV file, open it with a text editor, like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS.
+
Make sure the file you upload meets all of the following requirements, or it will be rejected:

* The delimiter is a semi-colon (;).
* Field and value names are not less than one character or exceed 20 characters and only contain letters, numbers, spaces, underscores ( _ ), and hyphens (-).
* The first line of the file has the column headings corresponding to the custom device fields that you want to add.
* The first column heading is *DeviceID*.
* Each subsequent column heading is the name of a custom device field.
* Each subsequent line of the file contains the value that you want to add in the custom device fields for a specific device.
+
IMPORTANT: If you do not want to specify a value for some of your devices, you can leave an empty value. Later, when creating a smart device group, if you set a filter value to add devices with a field that has a character different from _X_, the filter will also match devices that have an empty value in this field.
* There are no comments in the file.
