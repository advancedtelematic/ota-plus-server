= Create an update configuration

When you create an update configuration, you need to define two basic "assignment criteria".

* The *type of ECU* that the software applies to.
* The *current version* of the software that you want update.

*To create an update configuration, follow these steps:*

. Click https://connect.ota.here.com/#/updates[Updates], and in the top right, click *Create update*.
. In the window that appears, give your update a name and add a brief description.
. In the section *Select ECU Types*, select the ECU types to update and click *Continue*.
. In the next window, define the update criteria for the ECU's current software.
* If you want to update ECU's that are running a specific software version only, select the relevant items from the  *Software* and **Version** dropdowns in the *From* section.
* If you don't care what software version the ECU is already running, select the option: *Update to my selected version regardless of what is currently installed*
. Next, define the software version that you want to update *to*.
 * Select the relevant items from the  *Software* and **Version** dropdowns in the *To* section.
* Click *Save*.
