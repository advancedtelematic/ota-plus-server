= What is a campaign?

A campaign allows you to deploy software updates to groups of devices.

When you create a campaign, you need to specify the criteria that are listed in *Table 1*.

The groups of your target audience. Devices are typically grouped by attributes, such as region and model.

The software update defines the new software version that each device should receive.

It also refines your targeting criteria by specifying the hardware and software prerequisites for the target devices.
|====================

A campaign also includes settings that affect the end user experience.

Before you create a campaign, you also need to consider other criteria:

* Is this update going to disrupt the end user experience?
* Do users need to provide their consent before installing the update?
* How do you communicate the purpose of the update to the end user?

You can request the end user consent and write a notification text in the *Consent* section of the campaign wizard. For more information, see xref:create-campaigns.adoc[Create a campaign].
