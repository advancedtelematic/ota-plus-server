= Blacklisting Bad Software

After you upload and deploy software, you might receive reports that a particular software version has a defect. Eventually, you'll need to deploy a recall campaign to update the affected devices.

In the short term, you'll want to prevent anyone else from installing the defective software in another software update. You do this by blacklisting the software.

If you've blacklisted some software, you can see how many devices or vehicles are impacted by the defective software.

*To blacklist a piece of software, follow these steps:*

1.  Navigate to the *Devices* page.
2.  Search for a device that you know is running the defective software and open the device details for that device
3.  In the HARDWARE section, locate the primary ECU and click the info icon image:img::info.png[Icon,20,20].
4.  In the window that appears, click the *Packages* tab and use the search box to filter for the defective software version.
5.  Click the blacklist icon image:img::ban_grey.png[Icon,20,20] next to the version number.

*To see the impact of blacklisted software, open the Impact analysis page:*

* In the left-hand pane, you can see the total number of devices that are running the defective software package.
* The main graph shows you the proportion of devices running the blacklisted software package in relation to all devices running any kind of blacklisted software.
* For example:
** Suppose that you have 18 devices running the blacklisted software "IVI-Bluetooth_V2-1".
** In total, you have 33 devices running some kind of blacklisted software.
** That means, out of all the devices that are running blacklisted software, 54% are running the blacklisted software "IVI-Bluetooth_V2-1".
