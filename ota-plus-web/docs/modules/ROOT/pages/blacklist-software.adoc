= Blacklist bad software packages

This instruction is relevant for the devices that you built using Yocto.

After you upload and deploy a software package, you might receive reports that a particular software package has a defect. Eventually, you will need to deploy a recall campaign to update the affected devices.

To prevent anyone else from installing the defective software package in another software update, you can blacklist the software package.

*To blacklist a software package:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Navigate to the device that is running the defective software package, and then, click the device.
+
The page with the device details opens.
. In the *Hardware* pane, next to the needed primary control unit, click the information icon image:img::info_modified.png[Icon,20,20].
. In *Reports by this control unit*, click the *Packages* tab, and then navigate to the defective software package.
. Next to the defective software package, click the blacklist icon image:img::ban_grey_modified.png[Icon,20,20].
. In the *Blacklist* dialog box, in *Comment*, specify why you are blacklisting this software package.

Next to the blacklisted software package, the active blacklist icon appears image:img::ban_red.png[Icon,20,20].

After you blacklist a software package, you can see how many devices or vehicles are impacted by it.

To see the impact of the blacklisted software package, go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/impact-analysis[*Impact*, window="_blank"] tab. You can find the following information:

* In the *Blacklisted packages* pane, you can see the list of blacklisted software packages and the total number of devices that run each defective software package.
* The main graph shows you the proportion of devices that run the specific blacklisted software package in relation to all devices that run any kind of blacklisted software package.
