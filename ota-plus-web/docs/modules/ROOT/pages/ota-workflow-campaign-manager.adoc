= The Workflow of an OTA Update

To deploy OTA updates in production, we use the concept of a campaign. We'll go into more details about campaigns later, but to understand the workflow, you first need to understand what goes into a campaign.

A campaign consists of the following elements:

* The relevant software update and the supported hardware.
* The new software versions to which you want to update.
* The groups of devices that you want to target for this update.

In the OTA workflow, you set up each of these elements in a specific order.

Connect your devices to the OTA Connect server. The server stores the following information about each device:

* The device name or identifier (often a VIN)
* The serial number and control unit type of each control unit in the device
* The software version that each control unit is currently running
