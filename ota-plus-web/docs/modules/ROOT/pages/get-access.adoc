The process of new account creation is now restricted and only available to contracted Customers due to the xref:getstarted::sunset.adoc[HERE OTA Connect sunset].

NOTE: HERE OTA Connect is only supported on the Google Chrome browser.

== Preconditions to create a new user account

Please take into account the following:

* New user accounts can be created only for contracted Customers.
* The request has to be sent from an already registered OTA sponsor or key user of the Customer.

== Procedure of new account creation

The procedure to create a new account is no longer self-service and requires the following steps:

. The new user creates a link:https://account.here.com/sign-up[HERE account^].
. The new user signs in to the link:https://connect.ota.here.com[OTA Connect Portal^].
+
The user will fail to sign in to the OTA Connect Portal, but we will get the user HERE ID needed to create an account.
. Afterwards, the sponsor/key user has to send an email including the email address of the new user to otaconnect.support@here.com.
. The OTA team creates the account and notifies the new user and the sponsor/key user when the access is enabled.
