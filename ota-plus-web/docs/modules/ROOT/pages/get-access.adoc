= Get access

You can only request to create a new account if you are a registered sponsor user.

NOTE: HERE OTA Connect is only supported on the Google Chrome browser.

*To get access to the OTA Connect Portal:*

. Ask the user for whom you request access to do the following:
.. Create a HERE account on the link:https://developer.here.com[HERE Developer Portal, window="_blank"].
.. Try to sign in to the link:https://connect.ota.here.com[OTA Connect Portal].
+
The user will fail to sign in to the OTA Connect Portal, but we will get the user HERE ID needed to create an account.
. Send an email with an email address of the user for whom you request access to otaconnect.support@here.com.

The OTA team will create the account and notify you when the access is enabled.
