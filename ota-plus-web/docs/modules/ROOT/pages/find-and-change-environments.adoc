= Find and change environments

You can share your environment with your colleagues and become a member of other environments.

*To find the list of environments to which you have access and switch between them:*

1. Log in to your https://connect.ota.here.com[OTA Connect account, window="_blank"].
2. Under the *Support* and profile menus, point to the name of the active environment.
+
You see the list of environments to which you have access.
+
TIP: You can also see the list of environments to which you have access on the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/environments[*Environments*, window="_blank"] tab.

3. Click the environment to which you want to switch.
+
The OTA Connect Portal reloads, and the *Home* page of the selected environment opens.

In the environments to which you have access, you can xref:manage-members.adoc[add and remove] members. If you need to have separate spaces for different projects, you can xref:create-environment.adoc[create] new environments.
