* The *type of control unit (ECU)* to which the software version applies.
* The *current version* of the software that you want to update.

*To create a software update:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/updates[*Software updates*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the upper-right corner, under the name of your active environment, click *Create update*.

. Click *Continue*.
. Define the update criteria for each control unit software package:
* If you want to update control units that are running a specific software version only, in the *From* section, select the relevant items from the *Software* and **Version** lists.
* If you want to update to the new software version on all control units, select the following option: *Update to my selected version regardless of what is currently installed*
+
NOTE: Older software versions might not upgrade properly due to version incompatibility, and devices already updated will receive the same update.
. To specify to which software version you want to update, in the *To* section, select the relevant items from the *Software* and **Version** lists.
