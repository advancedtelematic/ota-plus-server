= Manage access to features

If you are an environment owner, creator, or have the *Access Manager* access rights, you can give or restrict access to features for other members of the environment.
You cannot restrict access to the *Manage feature access* feature for yourself, environment owners, and environment creators.
Members with the *Fully restricted* access rights cannot use any of the environment features.

NOTE: You can restrict access to features on the OTA Connect Portal, but you cannot restrict access at the API level.

*To manage access to features:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/environments[*Environments*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Click the environment in which you want to manage access to features.
+
The page with environment details opens.
. From the *Members* list, select a user for whom you want to manage access.
+
In the *Feature access* section, you can find which features the selected user can already access.

. Do one of the following:
** To give access to a feature, select a check box next to it.
+
[.lightbackground.align_img_left]
image::img::grant_access.png[image,800]
+
Now, the user has access to the allowed feature in this environment.

** To restrict access to a feature, clear a check box next to it.
+
[.lightbackground.align_img_left]
image::img::remove_access.png[image,800]
+
Now, the user has no access to the restricted feature in this environment on the OTA Connect Portal.
