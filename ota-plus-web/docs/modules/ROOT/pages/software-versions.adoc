== Upload Software Versions

To make software updates available to devices, you have upload the relevant software to the OTA Connect server. As with many things in life, there's a hard way and an easy way to do this:

* The *easy way* is to upload software files in the OTA Connect user interface.
+
This method is fine if you just want to try out the OTA Connection functionality.
* The *hard way* is to locally build a filesystem image that is OTA-enabled and already has your software installed.
+
During the build process, the filesystem image that includes your new software is automatically uploaded to the software repository on your OTA Connect server. This method is closer to how software gets installed in production.
+
For an example of this method, see the instructions for link:../quickstarts/raspberry-pi.html[building a Raspberry Pi image].


*To upload a software version in the OTA Connect user interface, follow these steps:*

1.  In the main menu, click https://connect.ota.here.com/#/software-repository[Software Repository].
2.  Click the *Add software* button on the top right.
3.  In the window that appears, enter a *name* for your software, the software *version*, and in the *ECU Types* dropdown, select the type of ECU that your software is intended for.
4.  Click *Choose File*, browse for the software file, and click *Add* to upload the software.

If you want to upload another version of the same software, you can repeat this process and enter a newer *version*.
