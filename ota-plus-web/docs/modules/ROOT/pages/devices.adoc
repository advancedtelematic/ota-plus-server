Once you have provisioned your devices, you should see them show up in the OTA Connect user interface.

*To see all your devices, follow this step:*

* Navigate to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[Devices] page and select the *All Devices* or *Ungrouped Devices* menu items.

If you haven't created any device groups yet, all your provisioned devices should show up as "ungrouped".

Click the name of a device in the main list to see more details for that device.

== Group Your Devices

Once you've provisioned enough devices, you should organize them into groups that you can target with software update campaigns.

There have two types of group: *fixed group* and *smart group*. The *smart group* type is better for organizing large fleets that are constantly changing.

*To create a smart group, follow these steps:*

1.  Open the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[Devices] tab and click *+Add group*.
2.  Select *Smart Group* and click Next.
3.  In the next window, enter a group name and define a filter for your devices.
+
A filter helps OTA Connect assign each vehicle to a fleet. Currently, OTA Connect can filter based on characters in the Device ID â€” this is usually the VIN number of the connected vehicle.
+
* To create a filter, select *Device ID* from the *Data* dropdown.
* In the Filter dropdown, select your filter criteria.
+
Since every character in the VIN number has a meaning, we could select *Has character equal to*, enter the letter *M*, and select *in position 10* (the 10th character in a VIN number is usually the model).
* OTA Connect will tell you how many devices match this criteria.
4.  Assuming you have devices that match, click *Create* to create your smart group.
+
The smart group is "smart" because any new vehicles that register with OTA Connect will be filtered into this group as long as they also match the filter criteria.
