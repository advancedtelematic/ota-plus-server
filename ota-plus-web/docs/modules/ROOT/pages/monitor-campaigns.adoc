= Monitor Campaigns

After you launch a campaign you can open the *Campaign Details* to monitor the progress of the campaign and look for any installation issues.

*To see the Campaign Details, follow these steps:*

Click *Campaigns* and click a status tab.

* Assuming your campaign is still running you would click the *Running* tab.
* If your campaign is a test campaign, it might finish quickly, in which case, you'll find it on the *Finished* tab

In the campaign list, click your campaign.

You should see the progress details for your campaign.

You'll see a summary of all the update attempts for each device grouped by status:

*Failed* indicates the number of devices where the update attempt failed.

* If there are update failures, the campaign details include a breakdown by individual failure code.
* To get a list of individual devices affected by the failure code, click the Export image::download.png[Icon,20,20] button next to the relevant failure code.

*Successful* indicates the number of devices where the software was successfully updated.

*Installing* indicates the number of devices that have received the update campaign, but have not yet sent a success or failure code.

*Not Applicable* indicates devices that were targeted by the campaign (that is, they were in a group that the campaign targeted), but were not processed.

* A common cause for this status is when the device is not running the same version of the software that is defined in the *From* criteria of the update, or if it doesn't have the model of ECU that the campaign is targeting.
* Another common cause is when a campaign was canceled. If a campaign is canceled, any devices that have not yet been processed (for example, because they weren't online at any time the campaign was running) will be marked as Not Applicable.
