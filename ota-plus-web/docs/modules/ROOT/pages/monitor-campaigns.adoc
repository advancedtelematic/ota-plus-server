You'll see a summary of all the update attempts for each device grouped by status:

*Success* indicates the number of devices where the software was successfully updated.

*Queued* indicates the number of devices that are still waiting to be updated.

* These devices might be offline or the OTA Connect server is waiting until a previous batch of updates has completed.

*Failure* indicates the number of devices where the update attempt failed.

* If there are update failures, the campaign details include a breakdown by individual failure code.
* To get a list of individual devices affected by the failure code, click the Export image::img::download.png[Icon,20,20] button next to the relevant failure code.

*Not Processed* indicates devices that weren't processed by the OTA Connect server for some strange reason.

*Not Impacted* indicates devices that were targeted by the campaign by were ignored because they did not match the criteria of the selected update.

* A common cause for this status is when the device is not running the same version of the software that is defined in the *From* criteria of the update.

*Canceled* indicates updates that were canceled either on the device itself or from the device details page of an individual device.
