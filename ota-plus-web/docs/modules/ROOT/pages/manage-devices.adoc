= Single-device update

You can send software updates to devices in the following ways:

- To target multiple devices, xref:create-campaigns.adoc[create a campaign].
- To troubleshoot one device, <<install,install a single-device update>>.
- To send automatic tests to a device, <<turn-on, turn on automatic updates>>.

[[install]]
== Install a software update on a single device

If you just want to troubleshoot a device, you can skip the normal workflow of creating software updates and campaigns. You can install a software update directly on the page with device details.

include::partial$devices.adoc[tags=single-device-install-steps]

[[turn-on]]
== Turn on automatic updates on a single device

If you need to send automatic tests to a device, you can set your device to update automatically any time you push a new software version.

NOTE: Automatic updates only get created when you push a new image while auto-updates are turned on. Turning on auto-updates for a device does not trigger updates for any images that were already in the repository at the time auto-updates were activated.

*To turn on automatic updates:*

include::partial$devices.adoc[tags=automatic-updates]

. On the *Software* pane, select the software for which you want to turn on automatic updates.
. Next to the software name, turn on the *Automatic update* toggle.

The automatic update is now activated for the selected software. The update is automatically triggered when you push a new software image or a new version of a software package.
