== See all Your Devices

*To see all your devices, follow this step:*

* Navigate to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[Devices] page and select the *All Devices* or *Ungrouped Devices* menu items.

If you haven't created any device groups yet, all your provisioned devices should show up as "ungrouped".

Click the name of a device in the main list to see more details for that device.

== Install Software on a Single Device

If you just want to update the software on a single device, you can skip the normal workflow of creating update configurations and campaigns. You can install the software directly from the device details page.
