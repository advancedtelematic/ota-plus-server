= Add a custom device field

If you want to add new custom device fields, upload a new or modified delimiter-separated file. 

// tag::modified_csv[]

When you add a file, pay attention to the following details:

* The *DeviceID* column should be the first column. The order of other columns is not important as they will be completely overwritten.
* You can have no more than 20 custom device fields in one file.

// end::modified_csv[]

*To add custom device field, modify your file in the following way:*

. In the first column, specify all of the device IDs to which you want to add a new custom device field.
+
If you do not include a device ID in the file, its field names and values do not change. Therefore, when you add a new field, make sure to add all the devices in the file.
. In the next columns, specify all the existing custom device fields and the related values.
. In the last column, specify the name of the new custom device field and all its values.

You can now use the new field to target devices to smart groups.

====
In your future campaign, *February Update - Premium Berlin*, you want to target all your premium devices that are in Berlin.

You have already created the *Trim level* custom device field. Now, you need to add the *City* field with the *Berlin* value.

The file you upload should look like this:

```
DeviceID;Trim level;City
CAR1;Premium;Berlin
CAR2;Premium;Berlin
CAR3;Premium;Berlin
```

For a campaign, you want to create a *Premium Berlin* smart device group, and set it to target devices that match the following filter criteria:

* The *Trim level* field contains the *Premium* value.
* The *City* field contains the *Berlin* value.
+
You get three matching devices.
