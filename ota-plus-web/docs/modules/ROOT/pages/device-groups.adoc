= Device Groups

Once enough devices have been provisioned, you should organize them into groups so that you can target them in your campaigns.

There have two types of group: *fixed group* and *smart group*.

* The xref:create-fixed-group.adoc[*fixed group*] type is useful if you already have a fixed list of devices that you want to update.
* The xref:create-smart-group.adoc[*smart group*] type is useful if you know the selection criteria for devices to update but don't yet have a fixed list of devices.

Even if you do have a list, smart groups can also come in handy when your list is constantly being appended with new devices. Smart groups automatically group newly provisioned devices that match certain selection criteria.
