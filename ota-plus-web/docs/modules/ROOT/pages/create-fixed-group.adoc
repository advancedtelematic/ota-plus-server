If you have a large number of devices, you can add them to a fixed group by importing a list of device IDs.

To group devices by adding a list of device IDs:

. Create a list of device IDs.
+
Currently, there is no way to export a list of provisioned device IDs from the OTA Connect portal. The best way to create this list is to have your developers xref:ota-client::use-your-own-deviceid.adoc[define the device IDs] and ask them for the list of the device IDs that they provisioned.
// MC: This would be solved by https://saeljira.it.here.com/browse/OTA-3306 if anyone besides me cared about it.
+
Your list of device IDs needs to be a `.txt` file with one ID on each line. 
Make sure there are no carriage return characters, and the lines are separated only by new line characters.

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. In the *Groups* pane, click *Create group*.
+

. Select *Fixed device group*, and then click *Next*.

. Click *Choose file*.

. Select the file that contains the list of device IDs.
. Click *Create*.
+
The created group appears in the *Groups* pane.
Open the group that you just created and check that your devices were added correctly.
