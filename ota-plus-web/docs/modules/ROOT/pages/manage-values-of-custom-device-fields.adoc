= Manage values of custom device fields

If you want to edit or remove values of custom device fields, <<csv, upload a new or modified delimiter-separated file>>. You can also <<portal, edit field values on the OTA Connect portal>>.

[[portal]]
== Edit field values on the OTA Connect portal

You can edit any field value of a device on the page with device details.

*To edit a field value on the portal:*

. Go to the https://connect.ota.here.com/#/devices[*Devices*, window="_blank"] tab.
. Click the device for which you want to change the field value.
+
The page with device details opens.

. On the navigation pane, click *Custom device fields*.

. Next to the value that you want to edit, click the pencil icon.

. Edit the value.
+
NOTE: The value should not be less than one character or exceed 20 characters and can only contain ASCII characters [a–zA–Z0–9], spaces, underscores ( _ ), and hyphens (-).

. Click the save icon.

The device has now a new field value. After you reload the OTA Connect portal, your smart groups that are based on the field with the modified value are automatically updated with the latest changes. However, campaigns that targeted the device with the modified value are not adjusted: devices cannot be added or removed after a campaign has already begun.

[[csv]]
== Edit and delete field values using a CSV file

You can use a CSV file to manage values of custom device fields.

include::add-custom-device-field.adoc[tag=modified_csv]

*To manage values in the custom device fields, modify your file in the following way:*

. In the first column, specify all of the device IDs for which you want to edit values.
+
If a device ID is included in the file, its field names and values are fully overwritten. Therefore, when you want to edit several devices, no need to include devices for which all values are unchanged.

. In the next columns, specify all the existing custom device fields and the related values.
. Edit or remove the needed values.

Your smart groups that are based on the fields with modified values are automatically updated with the latest changes. However, campaigns that targeted devices with the modified values are not adjusted: devices cannot be added or removed after a campaign has already begun.

====
// tag::premium_german_example[]
Your *January Update - Premium Germany* campaign targets two devices of the *Premium German* smart group with the following IDs: *CAR1* and *CAR2*. Your *Premium German* group is based on the following filter criteria:

* The *Trim level* field contains the *Premium* value.
* The *Country* field contains the *Germany* value.
// end::premium_german_example[]

Now, you need to change the *Trim level* filed of *CAR2* from *Premium* to *Standard* and add the *Premium* value to the newly provisioned device (*CAR3*).

The file you upload should look like this:

```
DeviceID;Trim level;Country
CAR1;Premium;Germany
CAR2;Standard;Germany
CAR3;Premium;Germany
```

The *Premium German* group now automatically targets *CAR1* and *CAR3*, but not *CAR2*. However, the *January Update - Premium Germany* running campaign remains unchanged and still targets *CAR1* and *CAR2*, but not *CAR3*.
