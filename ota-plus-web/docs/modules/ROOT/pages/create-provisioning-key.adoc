== Get a provisioning key
:page-partial:
// tag::provisioning[]

**Device Provisioning** is the process of attaching individual credentials and certificates to a device. {product-name} automates this process for you, allowing you to use the same unmodified disk image on many different devices and registering each one with {product-name-short} the first time it boots.

Go to the {app-url}/#/profile/access-keys[**Provisioning Keys**, window="_blank"] tab of your profile.

// MC: Images don't render from included files, copied this image to "ota-client" until I can find a better solution (this topic is included in ota-client:ROOT:download-prov-key.adoc)

Create a new key, select its period of validity, and then download it.

It comes as a zip file containing a provisioning key and credentials for your build system to publish images. You don't need to unzip it; just save it somewhere. You'll need it when you set up your Yocto build or configure the {product-name} client.
