The parties agree to substitute for such provision a valid provision that most closely approximates the intent of such severed provision.</p> </li> <li><h3>Waiver</h3> <p>No waiver will be deemed effective unless set forth in writing and signed by the party charged with such waiver, and no waiver of any right arising from any breach will be deemed to be a waiver or authorization of any other breach or of any other right arising under this agreement.</p> </li> <li><h3>Limitation on Action</h3> <p>Except for your payment obligations or any unauthorized use of HERE's intellectual property rights, any action by either party in connection with this agreement must be brought within 2 years after the cause of action arose.</p> </li> <li><h3>Force Majeure</h3> <p>Neither party shall be liable to the other for a failure to perform any of its obligations under this agreement, except for payment obligations, due to force majeure circumstances beyond its reasonable control, provided such party notifies the other of the delay.</p> </li> <li><h3>Relationship</h3> <p>This agreement is between you and HERE. No third party beneficiaries are intended except if expressly provided in these Terms. In connection with this agreement, each party is an independent contractor and as such does not have any authority to bind or commit the other.

Unless otherwise instructed by HERE, you must provide notices to HERE to the address given above.</p> </li> <li><h3>Assignment</h3> <p>The rights and obligations of each party herein may not be transferred or assigned without the prior written consent of the other party, except that HERE may assign this agreement to an affiliate or any entity that acquires substantially all of its respective stock, assets or business. Any transfer or assignment attempted in contravention of this section shall be void.</p> </li> <li><h3>Entire Agreement</h3> <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and HERE regarding the subject matter hereof. The agreement supersedes all prior oral or written communications, representations, undertakings and agreements of the parties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgement, purchase order or similar communication.</p> </li> <li><h3>Interpretation</h3> <p>In addition to any other defined words in these Terms, the definitions set out at the beginning of this document apply. Words such as "including", "for example" and "such as" depict non-exhaustive examples. Headings shall not affect the interpretation of the agreement. Reference to a person includes a natural person, corporate or unincorporated body (whether or not having separate legal personality). Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa and a reference to one gender shall include a reference to the other genders. Defined words in their other forms shall be construed in accordance with their defined form. A reference to law (or similar) is to such law as amended from time to time.
