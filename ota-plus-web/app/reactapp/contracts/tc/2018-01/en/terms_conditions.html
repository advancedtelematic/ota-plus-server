    </p>
    <p class="p1"><br>(2) “ATS Garage Website” provides a user interface for the management of devices and orchestration
        of over-the-air software update campaigns. The “ATS Garage APIs” allow client software implemented on devices to
        communicate with the “ATS Garage” service to send configuration information, request software updates, receive
        notifications of software updates, and download updated software onto the devices. Further details to the scope
        of “ATS Garage” are provided on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.atsgarage.com/"><span
                class="s2">www.atsgarage.com</span></a>&nbsp;and/or in&nbsp;service descriptions and conditions provided
        to the customer at the time of the conclusion of the contract.</p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(3) The customer shall be allowed to use “ATS Garage” - stored and running on the servers of ATS or a service provider commissioned by ATS - via an internet connection during the term of this contract for his own purposes and to store and process data with its help and to implement API clients for or integrate API clients into connected devices.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p1"><br>(4) The customer registers for a number of devices that defines the initial scope of “ATS Garage”
        service. The customer may register additional devices or reduce the number devices at any time via his user
        account under the provisions in §&nbsp;12 of these Terms and Conditions. In the event of extending the scope of
        “ATS Garage” service these extensions are considered part of the existing “ATS Garage” contract and all the
        provisions hereof.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(5) ATS provides the customer with “ATS Garage” at the router output of its data center ("transfer point"). ATS is not responsible for the availability and maintenance of the data connection between the transfer point and the IT systems of the customer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(6) &nbsp;ATS reserves the right to update, change, add or remove functions and features of “ATS Garage” as required for the technical development of the product or due to new laws or jurisprudence or equivalent causes. ATS will notify the customer at least two months ahead of substantial changes or a removal of functions. If a change or a removal of functions and features leads to a substantial change of the scope of “ATS Garage” it will be deemed accepted by the customer if the customer doesn’t object in writing within two months after the changes have taken effect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p1"><br>(7) As far as “ATS Garage” runs exclusively on servers of ATS or a service provider commissioned
        by ATS, the customer does not require any copyright-related rights to use the software and ATS does not grant
        such rights. However, limited to the duration of the contract ATS grants the customer the non-exclusive,
        non-transferable right to use the “ATS Garage Website” user interface through a web browser and to exercise the
        “ATS Garage APIs” for the number of devices registered with ATS and to use “ATS Garage” for the purposes
        according to the “ATS Garage” contract.</p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(8) The customer does not have the right to incorporate “ATS Garage Website” user interface elements into any other product or service, or to use the “ATS Garage APIs” from other devices as those agreed upon, especially to provide “ATS Garage” to third parties.

Data storage by ATS is carried out with the sole purpose to serve as an integral component of the technical means to execute “ATS Garage”.

    </p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(2) The customer undertakes not to establish any criminal or otherwise illegal contents and data, and not to upload viruses or other programs containing malicious software into “ATS Garage”.

    <p class="p1"><br>(3) “ATS Garage” includes the allocation of storages space for 100 GB of data if not agreed on

    </p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(5) In the case of failure reports by the customer after business hours, the reaction time begins with the start of business on the next working day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(6) If a disruption of “ATS Garage” or a total software failure cannot be eliminated within a working day ATS has to inform the customer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>(7) Malfunctions of “ATS Garage” may arise which are outside of the control or influence of ATS. This includes, in particular, acts by third parties which are not acting on behalf of ATS, technical conditions of telecommunication and the internet, as well as force majeure. The hardware, software (e.g. client software) and technical infrastructure used by the customer and the configuration and reconfiguration (including changes to the client software) of the aforementioned may also have an influence on “ATS Garage” services. All circumstances mentioned in this paragraph and all comparable circumstances that are outside the control or influence of ATS that affect the availability or functionality of “ATS Garage” shall not be considered a defect of the “ATS Garage” service or a disruption in the above sense and for the purpose of the “ATS Garage” contract. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></span>
