# Setup development environment for front-end application

[![N|Solid](https://docs.ota.here.com/_/img/logo.png)](https://docs.ota.here.com/_/img/logo.png)

This documentation will help you to install and setup all the software and tools to run OTA Connect web application. 

This manual was prepared basing on MacOS.

### Installation - MacOS
#### Java

Java 8 (1.8) SE is required.

[Download Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) (you can get Mac OS X x64 jdk-8u261-macosx-x64.dmg)

You can use OpenJDK too.

After installation you can check:
```sh
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_191"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)
```

&nbsp;
####sbt - build tool for Scala

sbt 1.3.9 (higher should work too) is required.

[sbt documentation](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Installing-sbt-on-Mac.html)

In MacOS to install sbt you can use brew:
```sh
$ brew install sbt
```

After installation you can check:
```sh
$ sbt sbtVersion
[info] 	1.3.9
```
&nbsp;
####NVM - Node Version Manager

NVM is used for easy switching between installed node.js versions. This is not required for the project setup, but can be helpful.

You can install it by cURL:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```
[nvm documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

&nbsp;
####node.js & NPM - Node package manager
node.js 10.x is required.

npm is distributed with Node.js - which means that when you install Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.

You can [install node.js manually](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.18.0/) (you can get macOS 64-bit Installer: https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.18.0/node-v10.18.0.pkg) or use nvm by calling:
```sh
nvm install 10.14.2
nvm ls
nvm use 10.14.2
```

&nbsp;
####kubectl - Kubernetes command-line tool
Here are [kubectl installation instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

After installation you can check:
```sh
$ kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"16+", GitVersion:"v1.16.6-beta.0", GitCommit:"e7f962ba86f4ce7033828210ca3556393c377bcc", GitTreeState:"clean", BuildDate:"2020-01-15T08:26:26Z", GoVersion:"go1.13.5", Compiler:"gc", Platform:"darwin/amd64"}
```


&nbsp;
####kubefwd - Kubernetes port forwarding for local development
kubefwd 1.8.2 (the newest one should be fine too) is required.

Here are [kubefwd installation instructions](https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd)

Ensure you have a context by running:
```sh
kubectl config current-context
```

The install kubefwd by homebrew:
```sh
brew install txn2/tap/kubefwd
```

After installation you can check:
```sh
$ kubefwd

2020/08/27 10:29:16 https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd
2020/08/27 10:29:16 
Expose Kubernetes services for local development.
```

&nbsp;
### Configuration - MacOS

####Development hat/stage/environment configuration
You need to get a directory (which is confidential and is used per hat/stage/environment) from other developers.
```sh
fe-dev
```

with following files:
```sh
dev.conf
dev.env
dev-forwarding.sh
dev.env-original
dev.namespace
dev.properties
```

Now put the whole directory in the same directory when you have main project:
```sh
$ ls -a
.
..
fe-dev
ota-plus-server
```

&nbsp;
### Running the application - MacOS

####Installing node.js modules

In the project directory go to:
```sh
ota-plus-server/ota-plus-web/app/reactapp
```

And then type (it should be called only once):
```sh
npm i
```

It will install all the node.js modules (it can take some time).

&nbsp;
####Compiling scala files
There is a need for compile all the scala files.
Go to the main project directory:
```sh
ota-plus-server
```

and type:
```sh
sbt clean compile
```

Some warnings can appear, but this is fine.


&nbsp;
####Running the app - finally

#####You need to be connected to HERE VPN

Now open 3 terminal tabs:

| Tab 1 (kubefwd): |
| ------ |
Go to development hat/stage/environment configuration directory:
```sh
fe-dev
```

and type:
```sh
$ sudo ./dev-forwarding.sh 
```

You should see:
```sh
$ sudo ./dev-forwarding.sh
