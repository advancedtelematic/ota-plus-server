                   In many connected mobility domains, most notably in automotive, it is common to have a device, vehicle, or platform that has 
                    multiple independent micro-controllers or other devices networked together. ATS Garage is built to handle updates to those other 
                    micro-controllers even if they don't have an internet connection, or are too resource-constrained to run a full updater client 
                    themselves. The device that has a direct internet connection – the one running the ATS Garage client – is called the "Primary ECU", 
                    and is able to distribute firmware updates to secondary ECUs.<br /><br />
                    The term <strong>ECU</strong> comes from automotive, and stands for <strong>Electronic Control Unit.</strong><br /><br />
                    If you don't have multiple devices to update from one primary/master device, you don't need to worry about this functionality.
